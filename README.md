# NeuroVigilance

## Overview

**NeuroVigilance** is a security-focused AI infrastructure project that models the secure and scalable deployment of environments used to train reinforcement learning agents. It integrates modern DevSecOps practices, cloud-native technologies, and observability tooling to reflect real-world challenges faced by high-stakes organizations advancing toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).

The project is designed to mirror the responsibilities of a security engineer or infrastructure security specialist at cutting-edge technology companies such as OpenAI, Tesla, Amazon, Nvidia, and SpaceX.

Key features include:
	•	Full-stack infrastructure design tailored for RL-based AI workloads
	•	Implementation of robust, zero-trust security architecture
	•	Use of cloud-native tooling including containers, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and service meshes
	•	Real-time monitoring and alerting for AI model training environments
	•	Secure integration of AI models into operational pipelines
